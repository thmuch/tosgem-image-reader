# Atari TOS/GEM Image Reader

This is a small fun project a) to preserve my very first (IIRC) two [Java applets](https://snailshell.de/java.html)
from 1996 and b) to provide a means to preserve images in some really old file formats for the future.

## Supported image formats

- Monochrome GEM images (file extension \*.IMG)
- Monochrome GEM 32000 bytes 640x400 images (file extension \*.PIC or \*.DOO).

## TODO

- Import b/w PSC images. **P**aint **S**hop **C**ompressed was the native image format of my TOS
  application "PaintShop+" that I wrote around 1991.
- Convert the applets to ImageIO readers
